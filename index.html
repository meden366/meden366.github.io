     <h1>Mckenna Edenfield</h1>
     <h2>Freshman in Roswell, Georgia</h2>

     <p>I am taking online courses at Bob Jones University while gaining work experience during my gap year. I plan to study the fine arts and communications.</p>
<p>
  I enjoy servicing people and connecting with them on a personal level, and I am an active member of my church. I am a VBS volunteer in the summers and attend Bible study groups every Wednesday autumn through spring.
     </p>
     <p>
I also enjoy hiking, biking, books and podcasts / video essays, and spending time with my family.
